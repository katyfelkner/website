    <h1>Sisterhood is a team effort.</h1>
      <h4>Hello friends! I am running for president of Alpha Sigma Kappa because I love this organization,
      and I am excited for the opportunity to make it better. </h4>

    <h2>Experience and Qualifications</h2>
    <h3> Vice President, Alpha Sigma Kappa </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Recruited our largest spring class (13 members) and our second-largest fall class (15 members) </li>
    <li> Nine successful recruitment events per semester - can answer questions for future VP, recruitment committee, and social committee </li>
    <li> Successfully implemented new ideas, including invite-only Bid Night </li>
</ul>
    Because I have experience on our chapter's executive board, I am ready to lead effective meetings and help my fellow execs do their jobs.

    <h3> VP of Administrative Affairs, Independent Greek Council </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Restructured IGC Weekly emails to be actually helpful to chapter presidents </li>
      <li> Learned paperwork and attendance requirements for IGC chapters - as VP Admin, I tracked and enforced most of these requirements </li>
      <li> Familiar with the other chapters in IGC, our advisors, and the rest of the Greek Community </li>
    </ul>
    Because I know our council and our community, I understand the importance of listening to diverse perspectives on all issues and I am ready to strengthen our relationships, while maintaining our close relationship with our brothers in Triangle.

    <h3> Secretary, Out in STEM </h3>
    <h3> Engineering Representative, SGA Undergraduate Student Congress </h3>
    <h3> President, Oklahoma Senior Classical League </h3>
    <h3> Project Leader, Engineers Serving Others </h3>
    <h3> Member, Crimson Club </h3>
    Because of my diverse leadership experience outside of Greek Life, I am ready to help our Sisters grow by connecting them with opportunities across campus.

    <h2>Ideas and Proposals</h2>
    My goals for my term as president fall broadly into three categories: member experience, professional development, and supporting leaders.

    <h3>Mental Health Crisis Training</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask exec members, Judicial Chair, Candidate Educators, and Scholarship Chair to complete mental health crisis training within the first month of their terms</li>
      <li>Next semester, bring in a speaker to offer training to everyone in the chapter </li>
      <li> Ideas for sources: </li>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://training.sprc.org">Free online training</a> from Suicide Prevention Research Center </li>
        <li> Presentation from University Counseling Center - potentially coprogrammed with OUr Mental Health</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/take-a-course/what-you-learn/">Mental Health First Aid</a> from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mental Health Resources Reference Sheet</h3>
    This was also suggested during goal-setting at retreat. This should be executable withing the first few weeks of my term.
    <ul>
      <li> Include hotlines, OU resources, local providers, and links to reliable info </li>
      <li> Hosted on front page of ASK drive, with a bit.ly link for easy access </li>
      <li> Pin link in actives slack channel, put it in the topic of all groupmes, and include it on the bottom of minutes every week </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monthly Sister Dates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> This idea has been suggested before, and it's time to implement it!</li>
      <li> <b>Rules:</b> In groups of 3, do something besides study for at least 30 minutes. You can go to a meeting or talk, get food, or just meet and chat.</li>
      <li> <b>Pairing:</b> Randomized using this script. Manual post-processing to ensure that bigs/littles and roommates/close friends are not paired up.</li>
      <li> <b>Accountability:</b>  Google Form submitted by one of the group, option to include a picture of the group hanging out for social media! </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sister Tech Talks</h3>
      At retreat, we discussed in goal setting that we want to see more professional development opportunities. Giving sisters a space to practice presentations was one of the ideas that came up.
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Recruitment Event:</b> Let's showcase the technical side of our organization in our recruitment! Sisters can sign up to do 5-10 minute talks, and we can
      have fun science-related trivia and watch cool science videos.</li>
      <li> <b>In Chapter:</b> I feel like I know my sisters on a personal level, but I don't know what technical work they are doing!</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Sisters can present over undergrad research, internship projects, class projects, or just topics they like learning about!</li>
        <li> Fun, low stress opportunity for members, especially younger members, to practice presentation skills in a friendly setting </li>
        <li> Completely optional and designed to be low-stress </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    These tech talks will help reaffirm our identity as both a technical and a social organization.

    <h3>Streamlined Reporting to Exec</h3>
    Having a faster and more objective process for reporting potential problems to exec will benefit both reporting sisters and the exec board.
      <ul>
        <li> All reporting for hazing, harassment, risk management, etc. concerns will go through a confidential Google Form. </li>
        <li> Exec board will read forms and respond within 48 hours. </li>
        <li> All correspondence regarding reported situations will come from askbeta@gmail.com </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Keep all exec members in the loop </li>
          <li> Reduce stress for individual exec members </li>
          <li> Faster responses when one exec member is out of town </li>
        </ul>
        <li> After a meeting with the exec board, the reporting sister and the presiding exec member will sign a document that includes what was reported and what actions the parties have agreed should be taken.
          These documents will be kept in confidentiality by the secretary. </li>
      </ul>


    <h3>Exec Accountability Plans</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspired by Holmes Leadership Associates Leadership Development Plan. </li>
      <li>Basically, this is a plan where leaders identify target capabilities, then measure improvements on those targets at regular intervals. </li>
      <li>Implementation for ASK:</li>
      <ul>
          <li> Focused on action rather than leadership skills </li>
          <li> Each exec member will set SMART goals for their term </li>
          <li> Exec will discuss progress toward goals, rate their individual progress,
            and report to the chapter once a month. Minutes from these discussions will be open record and available on the drive. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

      <h3> Exec Board Transparency</h3>
      Exec meetings are already open and we do post minutes. However, we can do a better job of keeping the chapter updated.
      <ul>
        <li> Send out exec minutes with meeting minutes every week. </li>
        <li> Include a link to exec minutes in the weekly minutes </li>
        <li> In chapter, President's report will include a short (2-3 minute) summary of what happened in that week's exec meeting </li>
      </ul>

    <h2> Why I'm Running </h2>
    When I was a candidate, I looked up to the President SO MUCH. I admired her confident leadership, and I will be forever grateful for the way she mentored me.
    She pushed me to run for IGC Exec, which was the first leadership role I held on campus. I worried that I was underqualified, but she pushed me to run anyway.
    That position helped me develop the skills that have made me a sucessful student and leader at OU. <br/><br/>

    I would not be where I am today if it were not for an ASK President who believed in me and invested her time in helping me grow.
    I am running for President because I want to pay her kindness forward. I hope to serve as a mentor to the younger members of our chapter.
    I sincerely hope that I will be able to have the same kind of positive impact on someone that my mentor had on me.
    I would be honored if you would vote for me for ASK President.
    <br/>
      <br/>
    Lioness love, <br/>
    Katy
