    <h1>Sisterhood is a team effort.</h1>
      <h4>Hey friends! I am running for president of Alpha Sigma Kappa because I love this organization,
      and I am excited for the opportunity to make it better. </h4>
    <h2>Ideas and Proposals</h2>
    My goals for my term as president fall broadly into three categories: member experience, professional development, and supporting leaders.

    <h3>Mental Health Crisis Training</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask exec members, Judicial Chair, Candidate Educators, and Scholarship Chair to complete mental health crisis training within the first month of their terms</li>
      <li>Next semester, bring in a speaker to offer training to everyone in the chapter </li>
      <li> Ideas for sources: </li>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://training.sprc.org">free online training</a> from Suicide Prevention Research Center </li>
        <li> Presentation from University Counseling Center - potentially coprogrammed with OUr Mental Health</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/take-a-course/what-you-learn/">Mental Health First Aid</a> from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mental Health Resources Reference Sheet</h3>

    <h3>Monthly Sister Dates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> This idea has been suggested before, and it's time to implement it!</li>
      <li> <b>Rules:</b> Do something besides study with a sister for at least 30 minutes. You can go to a meeting or talk, get food, or just meet and chat.</li>
      <li> <b>Pairing:</b> Randomized using this script. Manual post-processing to ensure that bigs/littles and roommates/close friends are not paired up.</li>
      <li> <b>Accountability:</b>  </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sister Tech Talks</h3>
      At retreat, we discussed in goal setting that we want to see more professional development opportunities. Giving sisters a space to practice presentations was one of the ideas that came up.
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Recruitment Event:</b> Let's showcase the technical side of our organization in our recruitment! Sisters can sign up to do 5-10 minute talks, and we can
      have fun science-related trivia and watch cool science videos.</li>
      <li> <b>In Chapter:</b> I feel like I know my sisters on a personal level, but I don't know what technical work they are doing!</li>
      <ul> <li> Sisters can present over </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Streamlined Reporting to Exec</h3>
      online form
      signed agreements about action moving forward - kept on file with secretary


    <h3>Exec Accountability Plans</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspired by Holmes Leadership Associates Leadership Development Plan. </li>
      <li>Basically, this is a plan where leaders identify target capabilities, then measure improvements on those targets at regular intervals. </li>
      <li>Implementation for ASK:</li>
      <ul>
          <li> Focused on action rather than leadership skills </li>
          <li> Each exec member will set SMART goals for their term </li>
          <li> Exec will discuss progress toward goals, rate their individual progress,
            and report to the chapter once a month. Minutes from these discussions will be open record and available on the drive. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    Know people well, know everyone's name

    Weaknesses:
      My Way or the Highway
      TASK relationship - mention relationships with other IGC chapters
      Being unbiased - keeping strong opinions to myself
